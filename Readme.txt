### AWS Math Web Application

Welcome to the **Math Web Application**! This simple web application leverages five different AWS services to design and build a fully functional, serverless application from scratch. The application includes features such as hosting a web page, performing serverless computations, and interacting with a NoSQL database. Below, you'll find details about each AWS service used and instructions to follow along.

---

## **AWS Services Used**

### 1. **AWS Amplify**
- **Purpose:** Amplify is used to build and host the website.
- **Note:** In this project, a text editor (such as Notepad) is used to create a simple `index.html` page, which is then deployed using AWS Amplify.

### 2. **AWS Lambda**
- **Purpose:** Lambda allows running serverless code upon specific triggers, such as an HTTP request.
- **Code:** The `PowerOfMathFunction` Lambda function handles mathematical computations.

### 3. **Amazon API Gateway**
- **Purpose:** API Gateway is used to build HTTP, REST, and WebSocket APIs. In this application, it acts as the entry point for the `PowerOfMathFunction` Lambda function.

### 4. **Amazon DynamoDB**
- **Purpose:** A serverless NoSQL database to store and retrieve data, if needed.

### 5. **AWS Identity & Access Management (IAM)**
- **Purpose:** IAM is used to set permissions for the Lambda functionâ€™s execution role, ensuring it has the necessary access to other AWS services.

## **How to Build the Application**

### **Prerequisites**

1. A **text editor**, such as Notepad, Visual Studio Code, or Notepad++.
2. An **AWS account** with access to the AWS Management Console. Ensure you have administrator permissions. (Need help setting up? [Watch this video](#) for assistance.)
3. Basic knowledge of AWS is helpful, but beginners can follow along as well.

### **Steps to Build the Application**

1. **Create the HTML Page (Frontend):**
   - Use the `index.html` file provided or create your own simple HTML page.
   - Host the file using **AWS Amplify** for a fast and scalable solution.

2. **Set Up Lambda Function:**
   - Use the `PowerOfMathFunction` Lambda function code to perform serverless mathematical operations.
   - Deploy the provided `PowerOfMathFunction - Lambda-FINAL.txt` code in the AWS Lambda console.

3. **Configure API Gateway:**
   - Create a REST API using **Amazon API Gateway**.
   - Link the API Gateway to the Lambda function to trigger computations.

4. **Set Up IAM Roles:**
   - Use the `Execution Role Policy JSON.txt` to define the permissions for your Lambda function.
   - Grant access to resources such as API Gateway and DynamoDB.

5. **Optional: Integrate DynamoDB:**
   - Add functionality to store or retrieve user data or computation history using DynamoDB.

6. **Deploy and Test:**
   - Use the provided `index.html` file or your custom frontend to interact with the backend.
   - Test the application by performing calculations and ensuring all components work together seamlessly.
